XXH3 is the newer version of the XXHash family, designed to be even faster than its predecessors while maintaining or improving quality.

XXH3 is a non-cryptographic hash algorithm, designed for speed rather than cryptographic security.

The Hash.XXH3-128 shard provides a longer hash output compared to Hash.XXH3-64, which can be useful in scenarios where a lower collision probability is desired.
