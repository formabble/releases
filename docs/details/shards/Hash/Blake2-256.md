- - The BLAKE2 algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that's designed to be fast and secure.
- The Hash.Blake2-256 shard provides a longer hash output compared to Hash.Blake2-128, which can be useful in scenarios requiring more collision resistance or when a longer hash is preferred for security reasons.
