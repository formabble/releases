- SHA3 is the newer version of the Secure Hash Algorithm family with better security and effeciency.

- SHA3 is a cryptographic hash algorithm, providing strong security properties.

- The Hash.Sha3-512 shard provides a longer hash output compared to Hash.Sha3-256, which can be useful in scenarios requiring even stronger security or a larger hash space.
