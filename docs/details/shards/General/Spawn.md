- The child wire scheduled makes copies of the context variables of the parent wire. Any changes to said variables will not be reflected on the parent wire.

- Child wire is scheduled asynchronously and executes independently of the parent wire. Any pauses on the child wire will not pause the parent wire.

- Child wire is scheduled on the same mesh as the parent wire.

- Multiple copies of the specified wire can be scheduled. Everytime spawn is called, it will create and schedule a new copy of the wire.
