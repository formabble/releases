- The child wire scheduled makes copies of the context variables of the parent wire. Any changes to said variables will not be reflected on the parent wire.

- Child wire is scheduled asynchronously and executes independently of the parent wire. Any pauses on the child wire will not pause the parent wire.

- Child wire is scheduled on the same mesh as the parent wire.

- And only schedule one unique copy of a wire at a time. Meaning, if there is another call for `Detach` to detach the exact same wire, it will be ignored if the said wire is still running.
