- A global shader variable is a variable that is available for use across all entry points at the same stage. This means that when `Shader.WriteGlobal` creates a global variable in the Vertex stage, it is now available to all entry points after the entry point that created it. It is however not available in the Fragment stage. Similarly, global shader variables created in the Fragment stage are not available in the Vertex stage.
