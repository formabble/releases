If the input value is negative, the shard will interpret them as angles measured clockwise from the positive x-axis.

Sin is a periodic function where the value repeats every 2Ï€.

Sin is bounded and will always return a value between -1 and 1.

If a sequence of floats was provided as input, the shard will calculate the sine of each element in the sequence and output a sequence.

If a sequence of vectors was provided as input, the shard will calculate the sine of each component in each vector in the sequence and output a sequence of vectors where each component in each vector is the sine of the corresponding component in the input sequence.
