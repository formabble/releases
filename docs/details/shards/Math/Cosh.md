Cosh is not a periodic function. It does not repeat its values.

Cosh is unbounded and can grow to infinity as the input value grows.

If a sequence of floats was provided as input, the shard will calculate the hyperbolic cosine of each element in the sequence and output a sequence.

If a sequence of vectors was provided as input, the shard will calculate the hyperbolic cosine of each component in each vector in the sequence and output a sequence of vectors where each component in each vector is the hyperbolic cosine of the corresponding component in the input sequence.
