If a sequence of floats was provided as input, the shard will reverse the sign of each element in the sequence and output a sequence.

If a sequence of vectors was provided as input, the shard will reverse the sign of each component in each vector in the sequence and output a sequence of vectors with each component in each vector with its sign reversed.

This shard cannot accept a sequence with multiple types as input.
