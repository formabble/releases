If a sequence of floats was provided as input, the shard will calculate the inverse tangent of each element in the sequence and output a sequence.

If a sequence of vectors was provided as input, the shard will calculate the inverse tangent of each component in each vector in the sequence and output a sequence of vectors where each component in each vector is the inverse tangent of the corresponding component in the input sequence.
