If the input value is negative, the shard will interpret them as angles measured clockwise from the positive x-axis.

Tan is a periodic function where the value repeats every 2Ï€.

Tan is unbounded but has periodic discontinuities.

If a sequence of floats was provided as input, the shard will calculate the tanget of each element in the sequence and output a sequence.

If a sequence of vectors was provided as input, the shard will calculate the tangent of each component in each vector in the sequence and output a sequence of vectors where each component in each vector is the tangent of the corresponding component in the input sequence.
