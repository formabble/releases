If a sequence of floats was provided as input, the shard will calculate `2^x` for each element in the sequence and output a sequence.

If a sequence of vectors was provided as input, the shard will calculate `2^x` for each component in each vector in the sequence and output a sequence of vectors where each component in each vector is the result of the exponential calculation of the corresponding component in the input sequence.
